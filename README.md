To upload large files:
1. Install Git LFS and follow all steps in https://git-lfs.github.com/
2. If large files are not yet committed, commit files as usual and push them to remote
3. If large files are already committed, run git lfs migrate import --include="/path/to/file" using *.extension for files of same extension & run git push --force
